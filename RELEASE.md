# SHIELD_XENSIV_A sensor shield support library

The XENSIV&trade; sensor shield (SHIELD_XENSIV_A) has been designed such that a TFT display, several sensors, microphones can interface with an Arduino based baseboard.

## What's Included?

This library includes support for each of the hardware components included on the shield:
- XENSIV&trade; 60 GHz radar sensor (BGT60LTR11AIP)
- XENSIV&trade; Digital barometric pressure and temperature sensor (DPS368)
- XENSIV&trade; Disruptive CO2 sensor (PAS CO2)
- 0.96 inch TFT display (ST7735S)
- Digital humidity and temperature sensor (SHT35)
- Motion sensor (BMI270)
- Magnetometer sensor (BMM350)
- XENSIV&trade; MEMS digital microphone (IM72D128)

Refer to the [README.md](./README.md) and the [API Reference Guide](./api_reference.md) for a complete description of the SHIELD_XENSIV_A.
